A simple blogging application created with Ruby on Rails. The application demonstrates basica usage of the Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC) structure, in addition to routing, migrations, RESTful design, and views (forms, partials, and helpers) within Rails. User authentication through the Sorcery gem has also been implemented.

Important note: Before creating any articles, a user must be created at /authors/new. Only authenticated users can create other users or create, edit, or delete content.
